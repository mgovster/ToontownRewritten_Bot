# ToontownRewritten_Bot
This is from a fun game made in 2003 called Toontown. The game closed in 2013 and many servers were created to replicate the game, some with special twists. The server used for this is Toontown Rewritten which is most notable for being closest to the original Toontown Rewritten. This bot is written in Python, eventually will add C++ because some sections need to be faster. This bot might be able to have very similar mechanics to the toontown corporate clash bot, but some added parts. Once all sections are created and mostly debugged, all segments will be combined into one for a simple use for the user.

This repository will have bots to these categories:
    <li>_ Trolley Bot: (Start the bot facing the trolley and let the bot do the work, when you hear 3 beeps, that means it is looking for a            yes or no answer. Having mouse at left half of screen is to not play again, right half is to play again. A confirmation will            be played to play again)</li>
    <li>_ Gag Training Bot: (Start from the entrance of the gag shop, start bot, and input street and gag you want to go to to train (and              train, if lure was chosen, another input (Not Toon-Up or Drop) will be needed to use after using lure, Toon-Up won't be able            to be trained yet). The bot will walk over to the first (and maybe second) battle buffer and wait until a bot comes                      (frequently jumping to avoid afk kick). Once battle ends, bot will decide based on health and amount of gags of the type(s)                being trained. Opencv will be used to read the health)</li>
    <li>_ Fishing Bot: (Still Planning idea for current and onwards)</li>
    <li>_ Pet Training Bot: (Train Doodle)</li>
    <li>_ Racing Bot: (Still Planning)</li>
    <li>_ Golf Bot: (Still Planning (might scrap))</li>
</ol>
